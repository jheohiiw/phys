Electric Field from Potential Graph V(x)

Problem:
The potential as a function of position x is shown in the graph.
Which statement about the electric field is true?

Key equation:
$$E_x=-\frac{dV}{dx}$$

Meaning:
The electric field depends on the slope of the V(x) curve.

------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 1 — Where is E = 0?

$$E_x=0 \Rightarrow \frac{dV}{dx}=0$$

Slope is zero at a local maximum or local minimum.

From the graph, the curve has a minimum near:
$$x=10\text{ cm}$$

So:
$$\boxed{E=0\text{ at }x=10\text{ cm}}$$

------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 2 — Where is |E| maximum?

Magnitude:
$$|E_x|=\left|\frac{dV}{dx}\right|$$

So |E| is largest where the graph is steepest.

From the graph, the steepest slope is around:
$$x=5\text{ cm}$$

So:
$$\boxed{|E|\text{ is maximum near }x=5\text{ cm}}$$

------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 3 — Direction of the electric field at x=5 cm

At x=5 cm the potential is decreasing as x increases,
so the slope is negative:
$$\frac{dV}{dx}<0$$

Then:
$$E_x=-\frac{dV}{dx}>0$$

A positive E_x points in the +x direction (to the right).

So:
$$\boxed{\text{At }x=5\text{ cm, the field points to the right.}}$$

------------------------------------------------------------
Final correct statement (in one line)

E is zero at x=10 cm,
its magnitude is maximum at x=5 cm,
and the field is directed to the right at x=5 cm.
