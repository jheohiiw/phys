\section*{Problem 1: Parallel Plates}

Two large parallel plates are separated by distance $d$. The electric field halfway between them has magnitude $E$. The separation is reduced to $d/2$. Find the new electric field.

\subsection*{Solution}

For two infinite parallel plates, the electric field between them is

\[
E = \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_0}
\]

where $\sigma$ is the surface charge density.

Notice that $E$ does \textbf{not} depend on the separation distance $d$.

Reducing the distance from $d$ to $d/2$ does not change $\sigma$, therefore the electric field remains the same.

\[
\boxed{E_{\text{new}} = E}
\]
